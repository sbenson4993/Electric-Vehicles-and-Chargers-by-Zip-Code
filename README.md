# Analysis 
## Purpose:
With the growing accessibility and demand for electric vehicles, there is a need to understand the strengths of the charging network to address both inefficiencies as well as any inequities. As more people rely on these  stations to charge their vehicles, they may be required to travel to areas they would not normally go or are inconvenient for them to reach. While charging from home is an option, the reliance of residents on these stations should not be discounted and understanding why traveling to these stations are inefficient is important. Knowing where these potential inefficiencies lie and finding a way to address them is important when addressing the development of future charging stations. Locations of charging stations can also result in not just inefficiencies but also inequities, preventing people from having easy access to these stations and inhibiting their ability to use their electric vehicles. Analyzing the current network in New York State is the purpose of this repository; serving as a way to highlight potential issues now while also being able to serve as a firm foundation for future analysis going forward.
